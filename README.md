# Coding Interview Practice

This repository serves as a log for my progress working through Gayle Laakmann's textbook, "Cracking the Coding Interview"

As the book suggests, I initially do my work outside of a designated code editor. [This Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVTwNxdgU-0lECNPHCs_j3yjGipXUEmwIPM2ACKBeAs/edit?usp=sharing) serves as my workspace before transferring code to a compiler and running it. For each problem, I record my ideas, questions, code, and then reflections.
